# Movie Scout

##  Description

Android application which provides users a way to search through movies and view there reviews and trailers.

##  Configurations

###  Movie DB API Keys

The APIv3 key for The Movie Db can be supplied under the `res/values/strings.xml` file and entering it as the value for the string named `movie_scout_version_three_api_key`.  The version four key is not used at this time.

##  Tested VM's

The applicaton has been tested on Android x86 emulators utilizing Android Marshmellow and Nougat.

##  Contribution

This application is being developed for a Nano-Degree program which I am currently enrolled in for Udacity.  Because of this I am not looking for assistance at this time.  Thank you for your interest in the project, perhaps in the future once I am finished with the program we can refine the app for an open-source project.

##  Target SDK

Since the requirements for the app did not specify a target SDK, I've decided to target Android Api 23 (Lollipop) and up as the minimum supported version.

This choice was made after reviewing the [Android Dashboard](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html) which shows that most users are running newer versions of Android and reading about several articles explaining of the various security issues with Android Kitkat and lower.
